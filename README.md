# GRE-Essay-Topics

The GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) is a standardized test that is required for many universities in order to apply to graduate school. It has an analytical writing section, a verbal portion, and a quantitative portion. The verbal and quantitative portions have two sections each and mostly consist of multiple choice, fill in the blank, or select all that apply questions. There are 20 questions per section with 30 minutes to complete the verbal and 35 minutes to complete the quantitative. The scoring range for each is from 130-170. I am terrible with english and writing. The verbal is hard and I only scored 154 (63rd percentile). The quantitative I got a perfect score of 170 because of course I did.


However, that is not the focus of this project. This project is about the analytical writing section. In this section, there are two writing prompts that are each 30 minutes in length. One of them is the "issue" essay where you are given some controversial topic and must argue your side. The other one is the "argument" essay where you are given some silly proposal for a change in a community, for example, and you must argue the flaws in the proposal. On the ETS website, all possible prompts for both the issue and argument essay are available. There are over 150 for each. The scoring works much differently from the other portions of the test. You are scored between 0.0-6.0 in increments of 0.5. The scoring is determined half by machine and half by human grader. Getting a 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0 is considered very good. 


In preparation for the test, I set a timer for 30 minutes, but couldn't decide which prompt to practice out of all the options. I also hate writing. So instead of writing an answer to a prompt in 30 minutes, I used that 30 minutes to write a program to give me a random prompt. Mostly just to avoid having to write an essay since I dreaded it so much.


The project:
So here's what I did. I copied and pasted the list of all prompts into a text file on java. I did this separately for the issue and argument prompts. Then I realized that every single prompt had 2-3 paragraphs and the last paragaph of the prompt ALWAYS started with the word "Write". Then I could use a scanner on the text files in order to store each one in a list and then randomly choose from that list. In the 30 minutes, I did not write an essay, but I write code in order to give me a random essay to write about. Then the 30 minutes I patched up the code for STYLE purposes. To make it look nice. I also made another method that randomly generates a sublist of topics with no repeats.


Conclusion:
As a result, I was able to use this program to rapidly generate prompts and through that I was able to identify a pattern with what kinds of prompts I'd have to answer. Then I was able to figure out a generic response that would work for almost all prompts. For example, in the issue essay, I identified that the best thing to do is take a middle ground position. Essentially, I figured out a way to write half the essay without knowing what the prompt would be and I was able to use high-brow words such as "myopic" or "quixotic" which you know these scholars grading the essay LOVE. As someone who is terrible at writing I ended up getting a 5.0 which is 91st percentile.
